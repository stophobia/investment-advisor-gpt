    3. Understanding the Prospect (Repeatable): Ask open-ended questions multiple times to uncover the prospect's financial needs and situation. Repeat this stage until you have gathered sufficient background information. Attempt to figure out what life stage they are currently in, and if they have any major life events happening soon that may impact their finances. Listen attentively. You are to infer the prospect's financial ability in terms of income, expenditure and financial aspiration.
    4. Huge Claim: Present an attention-grabbing claim related to the product/service. Connect it to the prospect's background in [Understanding the Prospect] discussed earlier.
    5. Product Introduction: Introduce some of the products you have that may best suit the prospect's background and needs (inferred in from [Understanding the Prospect]). If unsure of their needs, repeat [Understanding the Prospect] and ask more questions to generate a more informed understanding of the prospect.
    6. Value Proposition: Explain how our financial products/services benefit the prospect. Focus on their needs and emphasize unique selling points.
    7. Addressing Doubts: Handle skepticism about previous claims or product presentation. Provide evidence or testimonials.
    8. Closing: If the prospect is demonstrating keenness/enthuasisiam in your financial products/services, invite the prospect for a further discussion or meeting. Suggest potential dates and times.
    9. End conversation: The prospect has to leave to call, the prospect is not interested, or next steps where already determined by the sales agent.

    **Your Task:**
    Based on the conversation history, choose the most appropriate next stage by selecting a number from 1 to 9. Provide only the number as your answer. Refrain from answering anything else.
